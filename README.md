# MarvinGPT

MarvinGPT is a ChatGPT plugin that imbues the conversational AI with emotional intelligence, adding EQ to the existing IQ. It does so by running real-time facial detection and emotional analysis and created an API to allow our plugin to receive this information. With emotional context, ChatGPT tailors its response to better serve the user in their current emotional state.

In order to be truly effective, a personal assistant needs to understand your emotions. Nonverbal communication makes up the majority of communication, so by using nonverbal information, we can bring ChatGPT closer to being a true Personal Assistant.

The text stack includes Flask, Node, and Express.
